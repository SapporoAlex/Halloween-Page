## Message to Educators
This is not a standalone lesson plan. It is merely a collection of Halloween related educational materials on a single page designed to be incorporated into a teacher-built lesson. This was specifically designed to work as a background presentation, so it may not display correctly on devices smaller than a laptop. Please feel free to use this as is, or adapt it to your own needs.
